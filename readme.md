# PHP Basics Project 1
Using basic PHP skills to create a simple project of my own design. The user fills out a short HTML form, and once the form is submitted the user will see a results page.

## Getting Started
I used the localhost on my computer to test this project. This project does not submit into the database, so you can run the program as is once the zip file is downloaded.
